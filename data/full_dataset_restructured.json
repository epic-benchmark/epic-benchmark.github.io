Argueing about minor things mostly - curfews, clothes, doing chores, study habits, being disrespectful. While on the trip he and the guys sat around the camp fire and talked about many things, including family relationships. He started thinking about all those things he never thought to appreciate about his Dad - the help with homework, giving him rides to all his activities, his honesty, his caring attitude towards others, the way he made sure everyone in the family had what they needed. He realized how much he loved his Dad and that he was going to make sure when he got home that he told his Dad how he felt.",

Upon graduation he had several job interviews lined up, all in which he performed well. He accepted a Sales Manager position and was confident he would perform perfectly with his brand new Business Management degree. After six months on the job, the CEO of the company told Joe that his performance wasn't up to par, he was overlooking basic details, and sales were at an all time low. Joe was relieved of his position due to the fact that he was too inexperienced to effectively perform as a Sales Manager; he needed more training and experience being a Salesperson first in order to adequately perform the functions of a Manager. Now Joe is having a hard time finding a Salesperson job since potential employers see his job search as a step down.

As he was well into some reps of lifting, he complained to the trainer that he couldn't do another rep.  The trainer encouraged him that he must fight through the pain and do at least 2 more reps of the lift.  The guy did.  He went home and was all kinds of sore for the next two days.  He continued this routine 3 times a week for a month.  As miserable as he had felt after the first few times he worked out, he seems not to get as sore anymore after lifting weights.  He felt good that he had endured the rough few weeks he was sore. In the gym now he can lift a significant amount more than he could at the beginning of trips to the gym.  If he never got the membership or if he had quit because he was too sore, he would have never been able to get in this better shape that he is in now.",

Wanting the antlers for his wall, he lay chase and tried to shoot the antelope.  As the antelope ran, he ducked under some trees to try to hide, but his beautiful antlers were caught tight in the branches.  The hunter was able to get his catch and hang the antlers on the wall.",
